That's why we designed 200 levels to not only challenge your skills but also your imagination. With its tight controls, Art of Balance is easy to pick up and hard to put away.\n\nThe goal sounds simple at first: Build a balanced stack from all given shapes, but there are plenty of challenges.

Three additional players can join in at any time and help you solve the puzzles.\n\nWith a relaxing lounge soundtrack and 8 beautiful environments, Art of Balance is the ideal fit for casual gaming sessions alone or with friends. Play at home or on the go and challenge other players on their Nintendo Switch.\n\n\nFeatures:\n- Play 200 levels spread across 8 worlds, each with its own unique lounge style.\n- Build alone or together with up to 3 friends.\n- Challenge your friends to split-screen matches at home or on the go.\n- Go online and play against other players from all over the world.\n- Aim for ever higher scores in the Endurance and Infinity modes."
