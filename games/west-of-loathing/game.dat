description = "West of Loathing is a single-player slapstick comedy adventure role-playing game set in the wild west of the Kingdom of Loathing universe. Traverse snake-infested gulches, punch skeletons wearing cowboy hats, grapple with demon cows, and investigate a wide variety of disgusting spittoons.\n\nTalk your way out of trouble as a silver-tongued Snake Oiler, plumb the refried mysteries of the cosmos as a wise and subtle Beanslinger, or let your fists do the talking as a fierce Cow Puncher. Explore a vast open world and encounter a colorful cast of characters, some of whom are good, many of whom are bad, and a few of whom are ugly.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• A sprawling open world, chock full of danger, quests, puzzles, and mysteries\n• Lush hand-drawn black and white graphics\n• Thousands of jokes, gags, and goofs\n• Crunchy turn-based combat (but only if you want it)\n• Liberal use of the Oxford comma\n• Over 50 hats\n• Disreputable saloons\n• Several gulches\n• A drunk horse"
