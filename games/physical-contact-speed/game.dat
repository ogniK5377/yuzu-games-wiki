description = "It is a game series where two people can play against one device.\nIf you play with your body in close contact, the match will be more fun.\nAny two partners, including parents, friends, lover, etc, are suitable.\n\nBecause it is simple and rules that everyone knows, you can start the game immediately on the spot. If you use the handicap function you can match the level of the two people.\n\nBecause the match-up time is short, I can play anytime and anywhere when I feel like it.\nOf course there is also a 1P play mode for one's time.\n\nPlease enjoy together! \n\n\"SPEED\" is one of simple and profound card games that will win if you use up your hand first.\nIt is characterized by requiring reflexes."
