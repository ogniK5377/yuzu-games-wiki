description = "Invisiballs is a competitive local multiplayer game for 2 to 4 players.\n\nPlayed on a single, top-down, shared screen, everyone controls an invisible ball inside a maze and must capture a golden artifact to win the game. Designed entirely around a new type of gameplay set in a minimalist universe, Invisiballs is simple with a deep learning curve. Nervous and precise, Invisiballs is for players who love to play competitive games with their friends."
