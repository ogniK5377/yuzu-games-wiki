Many weapon and ship upgrades allow players almost limitless customization options for their Nano Probe. \n\nSuccessfully navigate through hordes of deadly pathogens to destroy the diseaseâ€™s pseudo-DNA and defeat gigantic boss.\n\nFeatures: \n25 core campaign missions, and 5 Challenge levels for scoring competition\nDifficulty levels of both puzzle and shooting segments can be adjusted independently to suit every play style, making Transcripted an amazingly replayable experience.\nBeautifully rendered microscopic environments with animated backgrounds\nMemorable, ambient score"
