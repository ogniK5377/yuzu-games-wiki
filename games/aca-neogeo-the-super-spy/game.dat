Defeating enemies earns experience, which can be used in a Role Playing Game-like feature to level up.\n\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces.\n\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\n\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games."
