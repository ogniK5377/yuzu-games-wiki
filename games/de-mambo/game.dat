description = "De Mambo lets 1-4 players engage in Mambo Combat. Grab a Joy-Con™ and charge your measly one button and release at different times to do three different attacks! Knock your opponents off the screen and break the level however you decide (thanks to some flimsy architecture), to make your game marginally different each time you play. De Mambo is the first game by The Dangerous Kitchen, dedicated to all those who helped us reach this point.\n\nFeatures:\n\nOne Button Action \nEasy to learn, hard to master gameplay designed to use one action button and the Directional Buttons/Left Stick for movement.\n\nLocal Mambo Multiplayer \nSmash your friends/enemies in this 2-4 player dance of destruction.\n\nLoser Rail \nThe feature designed to give you a second chance, for those of you not good enough to win.\n\nFlimsy Architecture \nBreakable environment for reactive gameplay.\n\nSolo Mode \nA salivating, single-player gameplay extravaganza packed full of delicious gameplay variety.\n\nSurvival Mode \nDon’t let the invaders from space breach your personal space in this 1-4 player co-op mode where survival is the name of the game... Literally!\n\nColor Accessibility\nEnhance player visibility, by editing a palette of player colors that best suit you.\n\nDownloadable Content \nMore Mambo goodness coming soon..."
