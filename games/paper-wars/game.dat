description = "Paper Wars: Cannon Fodder Devastated is the refreshed, updated, remastered, and enhanced edition of the beloved Wii tower defense-like game! With updated graphics built from the ground up in Unity and a brand-new chapter where we've exchanged soldiers for zombies, it’s just better than ever!\n\nPrepare to face wave after wave of enemy soldiers and vehicles trying to cross the battlefield - don’t let them!!! Get in your tank, take control of the cannon, and wipe them out. Collect power-ups to call in an airstrike, use a special triple-shot skill, or slow time, well, to slow time! Simple and effective. Just be careful not to blow up the power-ups. Friendly fire, soldier! Friendly fire!!!\n\nThe game contains:\n• Three campaigns, each with 20 missions.\n• One brand-new campaign designed from scratch…\n• … with zombies in it! Fighting robots was boring.\n• Sketch-like art style that could only be created by sleepy kindergartners.\n• Three difficulty settings.\n• And a survival mode!"
