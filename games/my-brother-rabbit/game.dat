description = "My Brother Rabbit is a beautifully drawn adventure set in a surreal world that mixes reality with a child’s imagination. A young girl faces a terrible reality when she falls ill. The little girl and her brother use the power of imagination to escape the hostile outside world. Together they envision a fantastic universe that provides the play and comfort they need. In this magnificent land of make-believe, a little rabbit wants to nurse his ill friend the flower back to health in any way he can. On this journey, the rabbit must use his wits to decipher puzzles inspired by classic point-and-clicks to continue his adventure. Help the rabbit play minigames, find hidden objects, and assemble strange machinery in a world where conventional logic doesn’t apply. Join this colorful quest through five wondrous lands filled with robo-moose, levitating baobabs, giant mushrooms, melting clocks, and more unbelievable things that will make you question everything you think you know about reality."
