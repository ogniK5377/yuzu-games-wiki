description = "Parallel is a stylish neon puzzle platformer where you control two characters at the same time. You will need dexterity, planning, and timing, to guide the two luminous squares efficiently. Split your brain in half to make it to the end of the level!\n\nEnter Parallel’s abstract, colorful cybernetic world. Cunning traps, coordinated jumps and moving platforms will put your skills to test. Levels will never feel the same, the challenge will be open for hours!\n\nCO-OP MODE\nParallel is also about friendship and synergy. Have a friend join in, and cooperate to get through the hardest levels.\n\n• An original side scroller where two characters, living in separate universes, help and depend on each other without ever being in contact.\n• Single player and co-op mode: each player needs only one Joy-Con™ to play. Use both Joy-Con™ to play alone.\n• 30+ levels. Hours of guaranteed fun!\n• Tons of time challenges and bonus levels to discover!\n"
