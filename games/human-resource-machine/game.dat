description = "Human Resource Machine is a puzzle game for nerds. In each level, your boss gives you a job. Automate it by programming your little office worker. If you succeed, you'll be promoted up to the next level for another year of work in the vast office building. Congratulations!\n\nDon't worry if you've never programmed before â€” programming is just puzzle solving. If you strip away all the 1s and 0s and scary squiggly brackets, programming is actually really simple, logical, beautiful, and something that anyone can understand and have fun with! Are you already an expert? There will be extra challenges for you.\n\nFrom the creators of World of Goo and Little Inferno. Have fun! Management is watching."
