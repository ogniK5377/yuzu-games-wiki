Four levels of difficulty, six worlds to conquer, twelve mid and end-of-level bosses, seven god-like armour sets, five basic weapons and thirty-five magic combat spells!\n\nThe evil emperor Zaraaima has kidnapped the infant heir to the land of Dareca.

Each world is guarded by level bosses each sworn to bring about the king’s swift demise.
